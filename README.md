The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I did not use any outside resources to help me complete the project I only used the guide provided.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[Throughout the entire project the main difficulty was having no knowledge of any of how to do any part of the project. While working on the project I had to rely on the guide given to me in order to submit it but the problem with that was at some moments where I didn’t know basic rules for the language I was currently coding in, for example I didn’t know that capitalization or spacing can make what you’re typing count as something completely different. Another challenge I encountered but overcame during this project was when developing a program the amount of attention to what you are inputting is highly important. I learned this the hard way while working on the project by noticing that after I assumed I was finished with the base game I found out that my clues wouldn’t work when starting the game, when I fixed that I noticed it didn’t matter what button I pressed the buttons wouldn’t be registered while the game was playing, I also had to deal with the game automatically saying I lost even though I pressed the correct button. I resolved all of this by noticing that some of my lines of code had an unnecessary capital letter or an unnecessary period or comma mark. Overall all this hardships helped me understood the languages I was using for the project way more so I am grateful for them.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[During the whole duration of working on this project the questions that stuck with me were things like, how long on average does it take to develop bigger projects like a webpage or maybe another game but on a higher scale? This came to mind for me because it took me around thirteen hours to complete this project and input some additional features so it made me wonder when working for an official company how long would it take in order to finish a project that exceeds what I completed for my submission for the internship especially given the fact the deadline for a company may be shorter than what I’ve had to work with now.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I were to have more time to work on this project I would add a number of features such as, a life bar, each button being a different shape, different sound effects for each button, and a better background for the game. For the shapes of the buttons I would want them to represent symbols of famous game consoles such as the PlayStation logo, the Xbox logo, the Nintendo logo, the Sega logo that appears usually at the start of every sonic game for example. With the pressing of each button the sound that plays would be a random startup sound for whatever console that was my favorite for the corresponding company. I would also add a basic health bar that looks very similar to the Legend of Zelda games each heart would represent how many times you can fail before a game over. For the background if possible I would want it to be a transition of pictures from my favorite games on each platform and that would pretty much be everything I would add if I had more time to work on this project.]
